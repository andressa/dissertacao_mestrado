        with forecasting problems can overcome this drawback. In this
        paper, we propose a new fuzzy time series model called the
        two-factors time-variant fuzzy time series model to deal with
        forecasting problems. Based on the proposed model, we develop two
        algorithms for temperature prediction. Both algorithms have the
        advantage of obtaining good forecasting results.},

@article{Turner2010,
    abstract = {Change point detection makes predictions in data whose
        structure changes over time and belongs to a class of methods called
        time series methods. Machine learning is the design of algorithms
        whose performance improves with data. Techniques from statistics,
        such as change point detection, have received increased interest in
        recent years in machine learning. Many problems have change point
        structure: Stock markets exhibit change points when some
        significant economic event causes an increase in volatility,
        weather systems may exhibit change points during years of El Nino, and
        electronic systems show change points when devices begin to fail or
        configurations change. This paper focuses on detecting changes in
        the operation of satellite base stations. The aim is to provide
        predictions of device lifetimes or time until maintenance will be
        necessary. Typical reliability engineering uses survival analysis
        to find lifetime distributions and mean time between failures
        (MTBF). However, using change point detection we can make
        predictions that include information dynamically. For instance, a
        change in the measured weather conditions could signal an impending
        satellite signal loss due to an imminent storm. Modeling changing
        dependencies is also important; a change in the relationship
        between the external and internal temperature on a device should
        mean there is a problem with the cooling unit. In the mentioned
        examples, the weather change point occurred when the weather
        conditions changed and when the cooling unit began to malfunction,
        respectively. Unlike MTBF, change point detection provides probability
        distributions describing the likelihood of a failure, which is
        necessary in most cases since there is usually significant
        remaining uncertainty over the time until failure. The two key
        aspects are that change point detection can include information
        dynamically and model changing dependencies. We show how to use
        techniques from Bayesian statistics, namely change point detection,
        to model and understand electronic systems.},
